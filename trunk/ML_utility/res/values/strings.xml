<string name="howto_title">How to use myLock</string>
<string name="HowToFull">Quick unlock removes the need to slide to unlock. The lockscreen still exists but it will be automatically quick unlocked. This allows the side buttons to remain protected against pocket dialing and removes the redundant slide to unlock step.

<string name="Troubleshooting">Please see our faq and troubleshooting pages linked on our site (http://mylockandroid.blogspot.com) first. If you notice an issue that happens consistently, email me at myLockandroid@gmail.com. Be sure to list the problem symptoms and what other services are running in the Settings->Applications->Running Services screen. I am not responsible for issues that occur because of task killer apps. These are not recommended for android 2.0 and newer because android now has automatic task management.</string>
