<string name="howto_title">About quick unlock</string>
<string name="HowToFull">Quick unlock removes the need to slide to unlock. The lockscreen still exists but it will be automatically quick unlocked. This allows the side buttons to remain protected against pocket dialing and removes the redundant slide to unlock step.</string>
