<string name="howto_title">How to use myLock</string>
<string name="HowToFull">myLock automatically minimizes the lockscreen. Side buttons remain locked down, but waking the phone with the slider, keypad buttons, or power key will auto unlock.
If the phone reboots while myLock is running, it will start back up automatically with your preferred settings. Do not attempt to change the security pattern or create one while myLock is enabled. Always uncheck enabled first. </string>
