<string name="HowToText1">myLock skips the lockscreen for you. This means that you still wake up the phone with the power key or any keypad button while the slider is open, but the unlock screen will no longer be required.</string>
<string name="HowToText2">When you enable myLock, pattern lock is automatically disabled, and it will conveniently restore when myLock is disabled. Please note that start at boot will occur after you unlock the lockscreen or security pattern the first time, for OS security reasons. This may not work if you have wavesecure or screebl starting at boot.</string>
<string name="HowToText3">If you experience any problems, download Log Collector (free from the market) to email us at myLockandroid@gmail.com. Be sure to list the problem symptoms and what other services are running in the Settings->Applications->Running Services screen.</string>
