= Prefs reset after a reboot (updates from pre 1.3.2 caused this) =
To resolve this uninstall then redownload the app and any addon packages. There is no other way to fix this.

= MOST IMPORTANT: DOWNLOAD LOG COLLECTOR =
If you can email me a log immediately after a problem happens, I can know exactly why the problem happened and actually roll out a fix or a message to the dev of the app that caused the issue if it was a conflict. All you have to do is open Log Collector and put in our email (mylockandroid at gmail). In the subject, put the time you think the problem happened and what the problem was (IE: Lockscreen came back and wouldn't go away, Screen Came on but flashed back off, etc). If you can, please also go to Settings => Applications => Running Services and tell me what is running, that will give me an idea if any other persistent app is going that might not be putting things in the Log.

= UNINSTALL YOUR TASK KILLER =
Task killers cause the phone to run slower and cause massive problems for many apps. There is no benefit or upside.

= MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE CORRECT KERNELS FOR SETCPU OVERCLOCK =
I've had tons of reports of problems from setCPU users. It appears the fix is to install the latest version of the recommended custom kernel into your rom to support the setCPU app. Most often the problems come during underclocking in sleep mode. Your results may vary drastically when reunning setCPU. I haven't tried it, but I may soon. 

= What is the point of the status icon =
We've tried, but there is no way to work around the benefits of the status icon. Without it, you might experience a sudden loss of functionality and have to go back into settings & re-toggle the app. In my testing this seems quite rare, but I have posted a log with comments of a scenario I observed the error under while using browser. For more about this, check out the official android development post that explains- http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/02/service-api-changes-starting-with.html

= Why do the volume or camera buttons wake it back up sometimes? =
This is one of the rules of the lockscreen. When a timeout sleep occurs you have a short grace period in which the lockscreen isn't yet engaged, thus allowing any action at all to awaken it again quickly. That means any button, as well as even sliding the slider closed which normally doesn't trigger a wakeup.

= How do I use the app and still get handcent popups correctly? =
In handcent go to settings > poup setting > enable 'Screen on for Popup', disable 'Show on locked'. This will ensure myLock still works and the two don't cause havoc as they both attempt to react to wakeup. This is only applicable to the market auto unlock version. Your results may vary, however we do recommend disabling the show on locked so that handcent won't try to use the older lockscreen cancel code when it's already being cancelled by the auto unlock.

= It stopped working and won't work again even though I've uninstalled and reinstalled (alpha 2c) =

To get it working again the device needs to be rebooted by removing the battery for a few seconds. No other method of restart or re-install will get past the safety block the lockscreen imposes. The block will stop all apps from interacting with the lockscreen. I know this from testing with early versions that had different crashes which were fixed on the path from alpha 1 to alpha 2c. I have not yet had any crash scenarios for 2c reported, so things are looking good.

= It seems to wakeup very slowly or lagged. Sometimes it goes so slow that the lockscreen never goes away but I can slide and unlock =
This appears to be something that happens regardless of myLock. An example is if you slide it open you'll notice a responsiveness delay as the CPU tasks both rotating & redrawing the lockscreen at once. In addition, I've confirmed that task managers and task killer apps will create noticable lag as they have to frequently load the CPU anytime the screen is awakened to refresh their list of processes. We do not recommend using task management apps because android already polices memory usage very strictly to ensure stability.
