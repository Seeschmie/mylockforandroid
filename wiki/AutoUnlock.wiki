#summary the standard myLock version built around minimizing the lockscreen in various ways.

= Modes & Features =

Guard hardware slider
Show wallpaper during unlock
Guard during calls

= Locale Integration =

Locale security plug in features the abiltiy to have myLock start up or securely shut down with locale conditions. In addition you can set a timeout mode where if myLock is running it will then close securely if the phone is left idle (asleep) long enough while the conditions are still met.

= Wallpaper lockscreen with auto unlock logic =
This is a separate mode users can turn on with the auto dismiss version.
It is essentially a cosmetic wallpaper only lockscreen replacement that still auto unlocks
Some users complain that they still see the lockscreen. It is overall a better experience for these users to see wallpaper and perhaps a small message (or progress bar) saying it is unlocking.

==Lifecycle==
mediator sleep - launch show when locked (basic guard)
basic guard will register for user_present from the system

if slide guarded, exit self without dismiss (lockscreen sliders restored)
we will actually watch for this in mediator
we will send a call start to the basic guard to close it
we then prime to restore at next screen off as always

mediator wake while basic guard active: launch GuardDismiss (special autodismiss subclass)
Properties - show when locked & dismiss keyguard (also no history)
Sends self to back at focus gain (no callbacks to anything)

user_present goes off inside the basic guard
exits itself via send to back followed by finish
this exit should reveal the system properly and not risk any handoff issue
